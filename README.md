## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **User Submission**
- User uploads Spotify screenshot or shares playlist link
- Frontend validates and sends to backend

### 2. **Genre & Mood Detection**
- Backend analyzes submission content
- Detects music preferences (Christian pop, hip-hop, indie, etc.)
- Identifies mood (uplifting, worshipful, reflective, energetic)

### 3. **Audio Feature Targeting**
- System calculates target audio features:
  - **Valence**: 0.75 (uplifting, positive mood)
  - **Energy**: 0.65 (moderate-high engagement)
  - **Danceability**: 0.6 (rhythm quality)

### 4. **ReccoBeats API Call**
- Selects seed tracks matching detected genre
- Calls: `GET /v1/track/recommendation?seeds=...&size=10&valence=0.75&energy=0.65`
- Receives 10 real song recommendations

### 5. **Playlist Creation**
- Formats API response into two curated playlists:
  - **Main Playlist**: Top 5 recommendations
  - **Deep Dive**: Discover more tracks
- Each song includes title, artist, genre, recommendation reason

### 6. **Data Persistence**
- Stores results in Appwrite Cloud database
- User can view submission history
